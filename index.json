Else if $0 \u003c |a| \u003c 1$: vc by $a$.   Vertical Reflection (using $a$)  If $a \u003c 0$: reflect on x-axis.   Horizontal Scaling (using $b$)  If $|b| \u003e 1$: hs by $b$. Else if $0 \u003c |b| \u003c 1$: hc by $b$.   Horizontal Reflection (using $b$)  If $b \u003c 0$: reflect on y-axis.   Horizontal Translation (using $h$)  If $h \u003e 0$: ht $h$ right. Else uf $h \u003c 0$: ht $h$ left.   Horizontal Translation (using $k$)  If $k \u003e 0$: vt $k$ up. Else uf $k \u003c 0$: vt $k$ down.    NOTE: Sets (e.g. domain and range) do not have repeats (e.g. $\\{1, 2\\}$ ).\nNOTE: expand the macro/function as well when doing the equation (i.e. $y=|x+2|$ not $g(x)=|x|, y=g(x+2)$ )\nLesson 1: Relations and Functions Let $x$, $y$ represent an independent, and dependent variable, respectively.\nA relation defines relations between two sets.\nIt can also be represented as a set of ordered pairs with two values, $x$ and $y$.\nIt can also be defined as a referentially transparent and side-effect-free procedure (in computer science).\nRelation = List[Tuple[complex, complex]]\nA function is a relation where each value of $x$ corresponds with only one value of $y$.\nThe domain of a relation is the set of all values of $x$.\ndef domain(relation): return [s[0] for s in relation] The range of a relation is the set of all values of $y$.\ndef range(relation): return [s[1] for s in relation] Set Notation  ${…}$ defines a set. $(…)$ defines a tuple. $D{…}$ defines the domain of a set. $R{…}$ defines the range of a set.  Example  For a relation $S{(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)}$, $D_S{0, 2, 4}$, and $R_S{1, 3, 5}$. This relation is a function. For a relation $S{(0, 1), (2, 1), (4, 5)}$, $D_S{0, 2, 4}$, and $R_S{1, 1, 5}$.s This relation is not a function ($S(0) = S(2)$).  Interval Notation Note: using the definition in ISO 80000-2:2019.\n $($ and $)$ are exclusive endpoints (the empty circle in number lines) $[$ and $]$ are inclusive endpoints (the filled circle in number lines)  Therefore: $$ \\begin{align} {\\color{Maroon}(} a,b{\\color{Maroon})} = \\mathopen{\\color{Maroon}]}a,b\\mathclose{\\color{Maroon}[} \u0026= \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mid a{\\color{Maroon}{}The above fenced code block and its content is from Interval (mathematics) — Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia (by Wikipedia contributors).\nVertical Line Test The vertical line test can be used to determine whether a relation is a function. If for every vertical line on the appropriate plane, there exists only one point where the vertical line intersects the relation, the relation is a function.\nAn example of a relation:\n circle a circle centred at the origin, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points         Figure with identifier circ : circle a circle centred at the origin, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points\n  An example of a function:\n linear a linear equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points         Figure with identifier lin : linear a linear equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points\n  An example of a function:\n quadratic an quadratic equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points         Figure with identifier quad : quadratic an quadratic equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points\n  An example of a relation:\n inverse quadratic an inverse quadratic equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points         Figure with identifier inv-quad : inverse quadratic an inverse quadratic equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points\n  Ensuring a Relation is a Function To ensure a relation is a function, restrict its domain to make sure that all conflicts are resolved.\nFor example, for this relation:\n a relation         Figure with identifier restrict-rel : a relation   we can restrict the domain: $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R} | x \\ge 0}$\n a relation         Figure with identifier restrict-fn : a relation   Lesson 2: Function Notation $f(x)$ is pronounced as “f of x”, “f at x”, among many others. It means to replace $f(x)$ with the definition of $f(x)$.\nFor example, if $f(x)=x+1$, $f(1) = 1+1 = 2$ and $f(y) = x+y$.\n a function a function for use in the example below         Figure with identifier func : a function a function for use in the example below\n  $f(0) = 0$\nComposition of Functions Function composition is a useful way to make new functions. It is done using the $\\circ$ operator.\n$(f\\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$\nThis is pronounced as “f composed with g of x” ($g\\circ f$ is pronounced “g composed with f”).\nNote that this is similar to the funtion composition operator (.) in Haskell: (f . g)(x) = f(g(x))\nFor example, if $g(x)=5x^2+1$, and $f(x)=x+1$, then $g(f(x)) = (g\\circ f)(x) = g(x+1) = 5(x+1)^2+1$\nLesson 3: Properties of Parent Functions Even functions satisfy $f(x) = f(-x)$. (notice how even functions have even exponents (i.e. $\\frac{n}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ in $y=x^n+c$)) For example, $y = |x|$ is even, and therefore it is symmetric on the y axis:  an even function          Figure with identifier even-func : an even function   For example, $f$ is even, where $f(x) = -x^2-2x^2+4$, since $f(-x) = -(-x)^2-2(-x)^2+4 = -x^2+2x^2+4 = f(x)$.\nOdd functions (奇関数) satisfy $f(x) = -f(-x)$. For example, $y = x$ is odd, and therefore it is mirrored on both the $x$ and $y$ axes.  an even function          Figure with identifier odd-func : an even function   For example, $f$ is odd, where $f(x) = x^3+4x$, since $-f(-x) = -((-x)^3+4(-x)) = -(-x^3-4x) = x^3+4x = f(x)$.\nFunctions that are neither even or odd do not meet any of the requirements.\nFor example, $f$ is neither, where $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$, since $-f(-x) = -(\\sqrt{-x}) = -\\sqrt{-x} \\ne f(x)$, and since $f(-x) = \\sqrt{-x} \\ne f(x)$.\nTODO: diagram An asymptote is a line that the graph of a relation gets closer to, but never meets\nTODO: diagram Increasing and Decreasing Functions (possibly non-standard) Increasing functions (増加関数) are functions where $y$ always increases when $x$ increases. In other words, the slope is always $\\ge 0$. Another way to put it is that the derivative of the function never goes below 0.\n an even function         Figure with identifier incr-func : an even function   Decreasing functions (減少関数) are the oppoosite of increasing functions: They are functions where $y$ always decreases when $x$ increases. In other words, the slope is always $\\le 0$. Another way to put it is that the derivative of the function never goes above 0.\n an even function          Figure with identifier decr-func : an even function      Name Equation Graph Domain Range Symmetry Asymptotes $x$ Intercept $y$ Intercept Quadrants Increasing     Constant Function $f(x)=c$ TODO $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ $R{y\\in \\mathbb{R} where y=c}$ Even None None or all $c$ I and II Constant   Linear Function $f(x)=x$ TODO $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ $R{y\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ Odd None 0 0 I and III Increasing   Quadratic Function $f(x)=x^2$ TODO $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ $R{y\\in \\mathbb{R} where y \\ge 0}$ Even None 0 0 I and II Neither   Cubic Function $f(x)=x^3$ TODO $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ $R{y\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ Odd None 0 0 I and III Increasing   Root Function $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$ TODO $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R} where x \\ge 0}$ $R{y\\in \\mathbb{R} where y \\ge 0}$ Neither None 0 0 I Increasing   Reciprocal Function $f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}$ TODO $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R} where x \\ne 0}$ $R{y\\in \\mathbb{R} where y \\ne 0}$ Odd $x=0$ and $y=0$ None None I and III Decreasing   Absolute Function $f(x)=abs(x)$ TODO $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R} where x \\ne 0}$ $R{y\\in \\mathbb{R} where y \\ne 0}$ Odd $x=0$ and $y=0$ None None I and III Decreasing    TODO chart Lesson 4: Getting the Domain and Range of a Function For any function, get the parent function and put it into the following form: $$g(x)=af(k(x-d))+c$$\nEach parent function ($f(x)$) has the domain and range. To get the domain and range of the function ($g(x)$), substitute the $x$ in the domain and the $y$ in the range to $x-d$ and $y-c$.\nFor example, to get the domain and range of $(x)$, where $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$, and where $g(x)=\\sqrt{x-3}=af(k(x-d))+c$, substitute $x-d$ for $x$ and $y-c$ for $y$: $$d=3, d\\in \\mathbb{R}, x-d=x-3$$ $$c=0, y-c=y, c\\in \\mathbb{R}$$ $$D\\{x+d\\in \\mathbb{R} | x-d\\ge 0\\}$$ $$D\\{x\\in \\mathbb{R} | x\\ge 3\\}$$ $$R\\{y+c\\in \\mathbb{R} | y-c\\ge 0\\}$$ $$R\\{y\\in \\mathbb{R} | y\\ge 0\\}$$ Lesson 5: Absolute Values and Inequalities The absolute value of a value is the distance from 0 on the number line. Since distances are always positive: $|x|\\in \\{0, \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ To solve abosolute values, split $|x|$ to $-x$ and $+x$.\n$$|2x+3|\\le 4$$ $$2x+3\\le 4, -2x-3\\le 4$$ $$2x\\le 1, -2x\\le 7$$ $$x\\le \\frac{1}{2}, x\\ge \\frac{-7}{2}$$ $$\\frac{-7}{2}\\le x\\le \\frac{1}{2}$$ Inequalities When both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative number, it is “reversed”. $$a\\lt b$$ $$x\\le y$$ $$-a\\gt -b$$ $$-x\\ge -y$$ For example, to solve $3x-2\\le 2x+1$ and sketch it on the number line:\n$$3x-2\\le 2x+1$$ $$x\\le 3$$  an even function          3   Figure with identifier ineq-nl : an even function   Lesson 5: Inverses of Functions The inverse of a function reverses the operation that the function does.\nFor example, if $f(x)=x^2$ then $f^{-1}(x)=x^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ and therefore $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$.\nTo determine the inverse of a function, reverse the uses of $x$ and $y$.\n$$f(x)=y=2x^3+4$$ (flip $x$ and $y$)\n$$f^{-1}(x)=(\\frac{x-4}{2})^\\frac{1}{3}$$ Resources  https://www.georgebrown.ca/sites/default/files/uploadedfiles/tlc/_documents/graphing_functions_using_transformations.pdf (archive) https://www.sydney.edu.au/content/dam/students/documents/mathematics-learning-centre/functions-and-graphs.pdf (archive)  ",

For example, in parallelograms, the diagonals bisect each other.\nA right bisector is a line that bisects another line and intersects it by a $90°$ angle.\nM A B  Lesson 4: Length of Line Segments The distance formula can be used to calculate the length of a line segment on the Euclidean plane.\nTo get the length of a line segment $\\overline{\\rm AB}$ $A(x_1, y_1)$ $B(x_1, y_1)$\n$d=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$ or $d=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$\nd A B  Lesson 5: Application of Formulas To get whether a triangle is a right triangle, you can get the slopes of the three sides and see if there is a pair that is reciprocal to each other (i.e. $x=\\frac{-1}{y}$).\nLesson 6: Circles! The equation of a circle with:\n radius $r$ centre $O=(h, k)$ a right-top point $(x, y)$ is $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r$.  Other forms of this equation include $r^2=x^2+y^2$ (notice how it’s similar to the Pythagorean theorem).\nTo see whether a point $A$ is inside a circle, calculate $d_{AO}$ where $O=(h, k)$.\nFor example, $P(-5, 9)$ is outside the circle with $r=100$:\n $d_{PO} = \\sqrt{5^2+9^2} \\approx 10.3$ $d_{PO} \u003e r$ $10.3 \\gtrapprox 100$  r O O  ",
