[{"content":"Lesson 1: Relations and Functions Let $x$, $y$ represent an independent, and dependent variable, respectively.\nA relation defines relations between two sets.\nIt can also be represented as a set of ordered pairs with two values, $x$ and $y$.\nIt can also be defined as a referentially transparent and side-effect-free procedure (in computer science).\nRelation = List[Tuple[complex, complex]]\nA function is a relation where each value of $x$ corresponds with only one value of $y$.\nThe domain of a relation is the set of all values of $x$.\ndef domain(relation): return [s[0] for s in relation] The range of a relation is the set of all values of $y$.\ndef range(relation): return [s[1] for s in relation] Set Notation  ${…}$ defines a set. $(…)$ defines a tuple. $D{…}$ defines the domain of a set. $R{…}$ defines the range of a set.  Example  For a relation $S{(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)}$, $D_S{0, 2, 4}$, and $R_S{1, 3, 5}$. This relation is a function. For a relation $S{(0, 1), (2, 1), (4, 5)}$, $D_S{0, 2, 4}$, and $R_S{1, 1, 5}$.s This relation is not a function ($S(0) = S(2)$).  Interval Notation Note: using the definition in ISO 80000-2:2019.\n $($ and $)$ are exclusive endpoints (the empty circle in number lines) $[$ and $]$ are inclusive endpoints (the filled circle in number lines)  Therefore:\n$$ \\begin{align} {\\color{Maroon}(} a,b{\\color{Maroon})} = \\mathopen{\\color{Maroon}]}a,b\\mathclose{\\color{Maroon}[} \u0026= \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mid a{\\color{Maroon}{}\u003c{}}x{\\color{Maroon}{}\u003c{}}b\\}, \\\\{} {\\color{DarkGreen}[}a,b{\\color{Maroon})} = \\mathopen{\\color{DarkGreen}[} a,b\\mathclose{\\color{Maroon}[} \u0026= \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mid a{\\color{DarkGreen}{}\\le{}} x{\\color{Maroon}{}\u003c{}}b\\}, \\\\{} {\\color{Maroon}(} a,b{\\color{DarkGreen}]} = \\mathopen{\\color{Maroon}]}a,b\\mathclose{\\color{DarkGreen}]} \u0026= \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mid a{\\color{Maroon}{}\u003c{}}x{\\color{DarkGreen}{}\\le{}} b\\}, \\\\{} {\\color{DarkGreen}[}a,b{\\color{DarkGreen}]} = \\mathopen{\\color{DarkGreen}[} a,b\\mathclose{\\color{DarkGreen}]} \u0026= \\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\mid a{\\color{DarkGreen}{}\\le{}} x{\\color{DarkGreen}{}\\le{}} b\\}. \\end{align} $$ The above fenced code block and its content is from Interval (mathematics) — Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia (by Wikipedia contributors).\nVertical Line Test The vertical line test can be used to determine whether a relation is a function. If for every vertical line on the appropriate plane, there exists only one point where the vertical line intersects the relation, the relation is a function.\nAn example of a relation:\n circle a circle centred at the origin, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points         Figure with identifier circ : circle a circle centred at the origin, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points\n  An example of a function:\n linear a linear equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points         Figure with identifier lin : linear a linear equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points\n  An example of a function:\n quadratic an quadratic equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points         Figure with identifier quad : quadratic an quadratic equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points\n  An example of a relation:\n inverse quadratic an inverse quadratic equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points         Figure with identifier inv-quad : inverse quadratic an inverse quadratic equation, which fails the vertical line test because a vertical line at x=0 goes through two points\n  Ensuring a Relation is a Function To ensure a relation is a function, restrict its domain to make sure that all conflicts are resolved.\nFor example, for this relation:\n a relation         Figure with identifier restrict-rel : a relation   we can restrict the domain: $D{x\\in \\mathbb{R} | x \\ge 0}$\n a relation         Figure with identifier restrict-fn : a relation   Lesson 2: Function Notation $f(x)$ is pronounced as “f of x”, “f at x”, among many others. It means to replace $f(x)$ with the definition of $f(x)$.\nFor example, if $f(x)=x+1$, $f(1) = 1+1 = 2$ and $f(y) = x+y$.\n a function a function for use in the example below         Figure with identifier func : a function a function for use in the example below\n  $f(0) = 0$\nComposition of Functions Function composition is a useful way to make new functions. It is done using the $\\circ$ operator.\n$(f\\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$\nThis is pronounced as “f composed with g of x” ($g\\circ f$ is pronounced “g composed with f”).\nNote that this is similar to the funtion composition operator (.) in Haskell: (f . g)(x) = f(g(x))\nFor example, if $g(x)=5x^2+1$, and $f(x)=x+1$, then $g(f(x)) = (g\\circ f)(x) = g(x+1) = 5(x+1)^2+1$\nLesson 3: Properties of Parent Functions Even functions (遇関数) satisfy $f(x) = f(-x)$. (notice how even functions have even exponents (i.e. $\\frac{n}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ in $y=x^n+c$)) For example, $y = |x|$ is even, and therefore it is symmetric on the y axis:\n an even function       `  Figure with identifier even-func : an even function   For example, $f$ is even, where $f(x) = -x^2-2x^2+4$, since $f(-x) = -(-x)^2-2(-x)^2+4 = -x^2+2x^2+4 = f(x)$.\nOdd functions (奇関数) satisfy $f(x) = -f(-x)$. For example, $y = x$ is odd, and therefore it is mirrored on both the $x$ and $y$ axes.\n an even function         Figure with identifier odd-func : an even function   For example, $f$ is odd, where $f(x) = x^3+4x$, since $-f(-x) = -((-x)^3+4(-x)) = -(-x^3-4x) = x^3+4x = f(x)$.\nFunctions that are neither even or odd do not meet any of the requirements.\nFor example, $f$ is neither, where $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$, since $-f(-x) = -(\\sqrt{-x}) = -\\sqrt{-x} \\ne f(x)$, and since $f(-x) = \\sqrt{-x} \\ne f(x)$.\nTODO: diagram An asymptote is a line that the graph of a relation gets closer to, but never meets\nTODO: diagram Increasing and Decreasing Functions (possibly non-standard) Increasing functions (増加関数) are functions where $y$ always increases when $x$ increases. In other words, the slope is always $\\ge 0$.

The equation of a circle with:\n radius $r$ centre $O=(h, k)$ a right-top point $(x, y)$ is $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r$.
