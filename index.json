For example, in parallelograms, the diagonals bisect each other.\nA right bisector is a line that bisects another line and intersects it by a $90°$ angle.\nM A B  Lesson 4: Length of Line Segments The distance formula can be used to calculate the length of a line segment on the Euclidean plane.\nTo get the length of a line segment $\\overline{\\rm AB}$ $A(x_1, y_1)$ $B(x_1, y_1)$`\n$d=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$ or $d=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$\nd A B  Lesson 5: Application of Formulas To get whether a triangle is a right triangle, you can get the slopes of the three sides and see if there is a pair that is reciprocal to each other (i.e. $x=\\frac{-1}{y}$).\nLesson 6: Circles! The equation of a circle with:\n radius $r$ centre $O=(h, k)$ a right-top point $(x, y)$ is $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r$.  Other forms of this equation include $r^2=x^2+y^2$ (notice how it’s similar to the Pythagorean theorem).\nTo see whether a point $A$ is inside a circle, calculate $d_{AO}$ where $O=(h, k)$.\nFor example, $P(-5, 9)$ is outside the circle with $r=100$:\n $d_{PO} = \\sqrt{5^2+9^2} \\approx 10.3$ $d_{PO} \u003e r$ $10.3 \\gtrapprox 100$  r O O  ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Unit 1","uri":"/mpm2dp-0a/u1/"},{"content":" MathJax = { tex: { inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']], displayMath: [['$$','$$'], ['\\\\[', '\\\\]']], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true }, options: { skipHtmlTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'] } }; window.addEventListener('load', (event) = { document.querySelectorAll(\"mjx-container\").forEach(function(x){ x.parentElement.classList += 'has-jax'}) });    Lesson 1: Properties of Triangles Circumcentre The circumcentre is the intersection of all of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle.\n It is equidistant from the vertices inside in acute triangles outside in obtuse triangles on $M_c$ where $c$ is the hypotenuse in right triangles  To get the circumcentre of a triangle, get the bisectors of two sides and solve the linear equations of them.\nFor example, to get the circumcentre of a triangle with vertices $A(2, -3)$ $B(8, -2)$ $C(8, 6)$\n$$M_{AC}=(5, -2.5)$$ $$m_{AC}=\\frac{1}{6}$$ $$\\frac{-1}{m_{AC}}=6$$ $$N=M_{CD}=(8, 2)$$ $$m_{CD}=not exist$$ $$\\frac{-1}{m_{CD}}=0$$ $$2=6x+27.5$$ $$x=-17/4$$ $$y=2$$ $$(\\frac{-17}{4}, 2)$$\nCentroid The centroid is the intersection of all medians of a triangle.\n Inside the triangle Each median divides the triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area The centroid divides medians into segments whose length have the same ratio as $2:1$  Orthocentre The orthocentre is the intersection of the altitudes of a triangle\n inside in acute triangles outside in obtuse triangles on $B$ where $\\angle B = 90°$ in right triangles  Incentre The incentre is a point at equal distance from the line segments.\n It doesn’t lie on the Euler line  Others  The altitude is the height of a shape. In other words, it is the shortest distance of a line segment from a point to the opposite side. Concurrent means that points are meeting at a single point.
