TL;DR: If a term is removed during simplification, then it becomes a hole, but if not it becoems an asymptote. (or, a restriction is added when it is removed)

If a graph is restricted from simplification from factorization, a hole occurs at that point.

{{%eg id="1"%}}
{{<md>}}g(x)=\frac{x^2+7x+12}{x+3}{{</md>}}
{{<md>}}g(x)=x+4; x\ne-3{{</md>}}
Since {{<mi>}}x{{</mi>}} cannot be {{<mi>}}-3{{</mi>}}, there is a hole in the line at {{<mi>}}x=-3{{</mi>}}.

But, asymptotes occur instead of holes if the restrictions are zeroes after simplification.

{{%eg id="2"%}}
{{<md>}}h(x)=\frac{5}{x-8}; x\ne 8{{</md>}}
