To multiply rational expressions:
- factor the expression, then
- divide out common factors, then
- multiply the denominators (produce a GCF), then
- merge into a single rational expression.

To divide rational expressions, do the same as multiplying but use the reciprocal of the second one instead.

Remember to add restrictions. Add restrictions right after or during when you simplify that part, and not after you finish the whole operation. This reduces mistakes.
