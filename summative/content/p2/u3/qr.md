**Quadratic relations** are relations whose equatio is in the form
{{<mi>}}y=ax^2+bx+c{{</mi>}}
where
{{<mi>}}a\in \mathbb{R}{{</mi>}},
{{<mi>}}b\in \mathbb{R}{{</mi>}},
{{<mi>}}c\in \mathbb{R}{{</mi>}}, and
{{<mi>}}a\ne 0{{</mi>}}.

**Parabolas** are quadratic relations which are U-shaped and symmetrical.

The **vertex** of quadratic relations are where:
- the curve changes direction, and
- is either the maximum of minimum (in terms of {{<mi>}}y{{</mi>}}) point in the relation.

The **axis of symmetry** if the line that divides a digure into 2 congruent parts.

**Finite differences** are the differences found from the {{<mi>}}y{{</mi>}} values in tables with evenly spaced (constant difference) {{<mi>}}x{{</mi>}} valyes.

**First differences** are the difference between consecutive {{<mi>}}y{{</mi>}} values.

**Second differences** are the difference between consecutive first differences.

Note: if a relation is quadratic:
- its first differences are not constant, and
- its second differences are constant.
