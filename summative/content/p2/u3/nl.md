The **independent variable** is the variables that is controlled before the trial begins, and the **dependennt variable** is the one that is measured during the trial. It is usually affected by the independent variable.

**Non-linear relations** do not follow a straight line when graphed.

The **curve of best fit** is a smooth curve drawn to approximate the general path or trend of a scatter plot.
