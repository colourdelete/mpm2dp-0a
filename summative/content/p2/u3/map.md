The **mapping rule** for quadratic relations is
{{<mi>}}(x, y) \rightarrow (\frac{x}{b}+h)(ay+k){{</mi>}}.

To use it,
1. list 5+ key points from the [parent function]({{<ref "p4/u8/pfn">}}), then
2. using the mapping notations, determine the new coordinates of the key points, then
3. plot the new points.
