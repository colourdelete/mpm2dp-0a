## Lesson 1: Properties of Triangles

### Circumcentre

The **circumcentre** is the intersection of all of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle.
- It is equidistant from the vertices
- inside in acute triangles
- outside in obtuse triangles
- on `$M_c$` where `$c$` is the hypotenuse in right triangles

To get the circumcentre of a triangle, get the bisectors of two sides and solve the linear equations of them.

For example, to get the circumcentre of a triangle with vertices `$A(2, -3)$` `$B(8, -2)$` `$C(8, 6)$`

`$$M_{AC}=(5, -2.5)$$`
`$$m_{AC}=\frac{1}{6}$$`
`$$\frac{-1}{m_{AC}}=6$$`
`$$N=M_{CD}=(8, 2)$$`
`$$m_{CD}=not exist$$`
`$$\frac{-1}{m_{CD}}=0$$`
`$$2=6x+27.5$$`
`$$x=-17/4$$`
`$$y=2$$`
`$$(\frac{-17}{4}, 2)$$`

### Centroid

The **centroid** is the intersection of all medians of a triangle.
- Inside the triangle
- Each median divides the triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area
- The centroid divides medians into segments whose length have the same ratio as `$2:1$`

### Orthocentre

The **orthocentre** is the intersection of the altitudes of a triangle
- inside in acute triangles
- outside in obtuse triangles
- on `$B$` where `$\angle B = 90Â°$` in right triangles

### Incentre

The **incentre** is a point at equal distance from the line segments.
- It doesn't lie on the Euler line

### Others

- The **altitude** is the height of a shape. In other words, it is the shortest distance of a line segment from a point to the opposite side.
- **Concurrent** means that points are meeting at a single point.
