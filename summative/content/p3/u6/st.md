**Congruent** figures have the same size and shape.

**Similar** figures have the same shapebut different sizes.

The corresponding angles of similar figures are equal, and
the *ratios* of the corresponding sides are equal, and
is defined as the scale factor {{<mi>}}k{{</mi>}}.

Simiarly, the squares of the factors is the ratio of the areas.

The {{<mi>}}\sim{{</mi>}} is used to denote similarity.
