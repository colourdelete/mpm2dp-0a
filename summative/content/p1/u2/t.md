## Circumcentre

The **circumcentre** is the intersection of all of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle.
- It is equidistant from the vertices
- inside in acute triangles
- outside in obtuse triangles
- on $M_c$ where $c$ is the hypotenuse in right triangles

To get the circumcentre of a triangle, get the bisectors of two sides and solve the linear equations of them.

For example, to get the circumcentre of a triangle with vertices $A(2, -3)$ $B(8, -2)$ $C(8, 6)$

$$M_{AC}=(5, -2.5)$$
$$m_{AC}=\frac{1}{6}$$
$$\frac{-1}{m_{AC}}=6$$
$$N=M_{CD}=(8, 2)$$
$$m_{CD}=not exist$$
$$\frac{-1}{m_{CD}}=0$$
$$2=6x+27.5$$
$$x=-17/4$$
$$y=2$$
$$(\frac{-17}{4}, 2)$$

## Centroid

The **centroid** is the intersection of all medians of a triangle.
- Inside the triangle
- Each median divides the triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area
- The centroid divides medians into segments whose length have the same ratio as $2:1$

## Orthocentre

The **orthocentre** is the intersection of the altitudes of a triangle
- inside in acute triangles
- outside in obtuse triangles
- on $B$ where $\angle B = 90Â°$ in right triangles

### Incentre

The **incentre** is a point at equal distance from the line segments.
- It doesn't lie on the Euler line

### Euler Line

The **euler line** as the line where the circumcentre, centroid, and orthocentre.

## Others

- The **altitude** is the height of a shape. In other words, it is the shortest distance of a line segment from a point to the opposite side.
- **Concurrent** means that points are meeting at a single point.
