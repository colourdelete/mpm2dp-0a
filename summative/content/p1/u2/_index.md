## Quick Reference

- **Chords** are line segments that join 2 points on curves (e.g. circles).
- Right bisectors of chords pass through the centre of circles.
- There is only one circle that passes through three non-colinear points.
- Joining the midpoint of adjacent sides of any quadrilateral forms a parallelogram.

- The **circumcentre** is the intersection of all of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle.
- The **centroid** is the intersection of all medians of a triangle.
- The **orthocentre** is the intersection of the altitudes of a triangle
- The **orthocentre** is the intersection of the altitudes of a triangle
- The **euler line** as the line where the circumcentre, centroid, and orthocentre.
