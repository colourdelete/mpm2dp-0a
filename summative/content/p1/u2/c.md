Diameters of circles intersect at the centre of the circle.

**Chords** are line segments that join 2 points on curves (e.g. circles).

Right bisectors of chords pass through the centre of circles.

There is only one circle that passes through three non-colinear points.

A **circumference of a triangle** is a circle that passes through all three vertices of a triangle.
