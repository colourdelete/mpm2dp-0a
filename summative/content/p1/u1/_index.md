## Quick Reference

**Circle**: $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r$

**Distance**: $d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$

**Midpoint**: $M_{AB}=(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{x_1+x_2}{2})$

## Application of Formulas

To get whether a triangle is a right triangle, you can get the slopes of the three sides and see if there is a pair that is  reciprocal to each other (i.e. $x=\frac{-1}{y}$).
